				"content" : "Simply put, modular.js is an easier way to develop your website. It allows you to design individual components (modules) on your site without having them interfere with each other. Modules created using modular.js are completely re-usable without the need to copy and paste the same code over and over. Moreover, modular.js is easy to understand and does not require you to learn any new syntax. It is designed to stay out of the way, so feel free to use any framework alongside it -- Although it greatly reduces the need for large frameworks like angular.js. modular.js lets you develop modules as if they are self-contained websites and then augment their functionality when they are used in another document."

			{
				"header" : "Benefits of Using modular.js",
				"content" : "<span class="subheader">Eliminate Collisions</span>
					Every module gets its own shadow DOM to work with, so you don't have to worry about CSS or Javascript variables inside a module interfering with anything else.
					<span class="subheader">Increase Portability</span>
					Once you have created a module, you can re-use it in any other project without any modifications at all.
					<span class="subheader">Decrease Redundancy</span>
					Using modular.js allows you to reduce repeatable code down to a single line, so you only have to focus on unique information."

			{

				"content" : "Using modular.js couldn't be simpler. All you have to do is link the modular.js file to your document, and you're ready to go!
				<span class="code">&lt;script src=\"js/modular.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
				You can then reference any modules that are stored in the modules directory like so:
				<span class="code">&lt;module name=\"section\"&gt;&lt;/module&gt;</span>
				The above module will be populated with the code found in <span class="inlineCode">./modules/section/</span>"

				"content" : "<ol>
					<li>In your project root, set up the file structure by creating a directory called <span class="inlineCode">modules</span>.</li>
					<li>Inside of the modules directory, create another directory that has the same name as your module.</li>
					<li>Create a file called <span class="inlineCode">index.html</span> in the new directory, and fill it with any other assets and code that your module requires.</li>

				"header" : "Extra Functionality",
				"content" : "The code that goes into a module is no different than the code that goes into a webpage. Nevertheless, there are a few extra capabilities that modular.js brings to the table.
				<span class="subheader">Variable Substitution</span>
				Inside a module, you can specify where unique information can be injected by using <span class="inlineCode">{{ }}</span>
				<span class="code">
					&lt;div&gt;<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;{{header}}&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;{{content}}&lt;/p&gt;<br>
					&lt;/div&gt;<br>
				</span>
				When referencing this module, you can feed it information by constructing a JSON inside of the module body.
				<span class="code">
					&lt;module name=\"moduleName\"&gt;<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"header\" : \"This is the Header\",<br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"content\" : \"This is the content.\"<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
					&lt;/module&gt;
				</span>
				The resulting HTML will look like this:
				<span class="code">
					&lt;div&gt;<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;h1&gt;This is the Header&lt;/h1&gt;<br>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;p&gt;This is the content.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
					&lt;/div&gt;<br>
				</span>
				<span class="subheader">Accessing the Parent DOM</span>
				Although each module has its own shadow DOM, you can access the parent DOM that the module is embedded in.
				<span class="code">
					var parentDOM = document.parent;
				</span>
				In the same manner, you can access the parent of a parent, and so-on.
				<span class="code">
					var grandparentDOM = document.parent.parent;
				</span>
				<span class="subheader">Accessing the main DOM</span>
				In the case of modules that are embedded in one another, it may be useful to jump straight to the top of the DOM tree, a.k.a the main Doc.
				<span class="code">
					var mainDoc = modularjs.mainDoc;
				</span>
				This is made available to you through the modularjs object, which every module has access to.
				<span class="subheader">Sharing information between modules</span>
				If you would like to share information between modules, you can do so by adding key/value pairs to modularjs.sharedInfo like so:
				<span class="code">
					modularjs.sharedInfo[\"key1\"] = \"value1\";<br>
					modularjs.sharedInfo[\"key2\"] = \"value2\";
				</span>
				"
